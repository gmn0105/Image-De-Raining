Image De-Raining
Given an image distorted by rain or snow, you have to extract a clear background image. 

For example, given an image on the right half side, you have to extract an image as in the left half side, removing the noise generated by rain in the image.


Dataset
The dataset has 700 training images. You have to use only these 700 images for training your model.

Summary
This is an attempt of implementing the methodology and the neural network (GAN) architecture followed in the above mentioned paper using tensorflow. Some modifications had to be made due to lack of computational resources, however, if appropriate resources are available, the code can be used to train to the fullest to get the best performance.
